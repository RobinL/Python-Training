Well done for making it this far and I've no doubt that some of you are thinking 'Learning Python is all well and good, but when are we going to do some fun stuff with data and graphs?' Well you'll be pleased to hear that this starts very soon, but first we have to teach you some more practical stuff about Python so you're well equipped to deal with the second (and more fun!) part of the course."
