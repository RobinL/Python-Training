Exercise A: 	(Lessons 1 & 2)
Lesson 3: 		Functions Part 1 (Built in Functions,  Nesting Functions, Creating Functions, String tokens, Docstrings)
Lesson 4: 		Functions Part 2 (If/Elif Try/Except, Return)
Exercise B: 	(Lessons 3 & 4)
Lesson 5: 		Intro to data structures (Lists, Tuples, Dicts, Sets)
Lesson 6: 		Lists, Indexing and Slicing
Lesson 7: 		Methods
Exercise C:		(Lessons 5-7)
Lesson 8: 		Tuples
Lesson 9: 		Dicts 
Exercise D:		Using Dicts (Lessons 8-9)
Lesson 10: 		Converting between Data Structures
Exercise E:		Converting between Data Structures (Lesson 10)
Lesson 11: 		Sets (optional as I personally never use sets - what do you think?)
Lesson 12: 		List Comprehensions
Lesson 13:		For Loops
Lesson 14:		While Loops
Exercise F,G,H	(Exercises 12-14)
Lesson 15:		Cool Built in functions (map, zip, filter etc.)
Lesson 16:		Importing and using collections/modules/packages etc.


Section 2: Working with Data

Lesson 1:		An introduction to Numpy & Pandas
Lesson 2:		Arrays
Exercise A:		(Lessons 1-2)
Lesson 3:		Series and Dataframes in Pandas
Exercise B:		(Lesson 3)
Lesson 4: 		Indexing
Exercise C:		(Lesson 3)
Lesson 4:		Creating dataframes in Pandas (from csvs, excel, lists, tuples, dicts etc.)
Lesson 5:		Basic Dataframe functions (drop, rename, keep, where, sort etc.)
Lesson 6:		Converting between data types (arrays to lists to series to dataframes etc.)
Lesson 7:		Tips for dealing with shitty data (Nan, missing data, converting between columns types (e.g. int to float etc.)
Exercise D:		(Lessons 4-7)
Lesson 8:		Groupby
Lesson 9:		Aggregate functions 

Probably a bit more needed here? What do you think?

Section 3: Visualising Data

Lesson 1:		Matplotlib, Seaborn and Bokeh (any other suggestions)
Lesson 2-3:		Matplot stuff
Lessons 4-6:	Seaborn
Lessons 7-10	Interactive stuff with Bokeh

Section 4: Advanced stuff! (These may have to be single lessons that showcase the power and point to more material (which we could develop ourselves?))

Machine Learning
NLP
Interfacing with APIs
Web Scraping
Other popular libraries (Pillow, Django, SQLAlchemy etc.)
Using Python for GIS
